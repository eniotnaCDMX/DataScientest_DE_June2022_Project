The objective of this application is to analyze the content of comments related to the financial company "Wise" on the TrustPilot website. It is therefore based on the data contained on TrustPilot, offers the user the possibility to add a comment themselves, sets up a sentiment analysis algorithm to try to understand the links between ratings and sentiments, and what makes a sentiment positive or negative.

More specifically, it meets several needs:
